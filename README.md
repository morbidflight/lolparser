lolparser
=========

I'm creating a derpy parser to identify how many times you played a champion in League of Legends based on game logs stored on your computer. This project was inspired by lolparse.com, although that site is now defunct and the code is unavailable. You can see how it looked here: [Internet Archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20131118202544/http://www.lolparse.com/). All code here is of my own making. I have often wanted a way to get information about how many times I've played a champion, and most of the web tools out there only grab that information for Ranked or Normal games. I don't play those much, so I wanted to see how many times I've played. lolparse.com has been defunct for several months now, and I feel the lack. A series of greps of my own logs led me to frustration and so I decided to make something a little more...scalable.

This project might also turn into a means for me to learn JavaScript and D3.js, although we'll see about that. Right now I'm taking the easy way out and using python and running everything from the command line.

If you use this parser, please let me know and let me know what your top-played champions are. Open an issue or email me at gmail. Same username.
