UID = clientID of the person creating the game

If the game has EXITCODE that means it ended properly, not due to disconnect.
Each time there is a soft disconnect/reconnect cycle, it re-spawns the hero (Hero .(* created for user).

Step 1: Get the UID of the first file, use that to look up the summonername (clientID [0-9] and summonername (.*)): save what's between parens as summonername.
		Spawning champion (Ahri) with skinID 0 on team 200 for clientID 9 and summonername (morbidflight) (is HUMAN PLAYER)
Step 2: For each file:
Step 3: If the file does not contain an EXITCODE, do not parse.
Step 4: Else, get champion name (only the first one in the file) corresponding to the summonername saved previously and update the counter for that champion.
Step 5: Get EXITCODE corresponding to that file: EXITCODE_LOSE or EXITCODE_WIN

Possibly also get summonernames of teammates (shared teamID), check for all summonername () with teamID same as source


name	Orig?	Champion name	Number of times played	Number of Wins	Number of Losses
				Champion 2 name etc
mf		True	DrMundo			239						120				119
		True	Ahri			4						2				2
		
abz		False	DrMundo			3						2				1
						
						
OK let's start with just me, and just champion name and number of times played
So a Dict (Key = champname, Value = number of times played)
